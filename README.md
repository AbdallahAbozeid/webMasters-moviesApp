## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start editing.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdallahAbozeid/webMasters-moviesApp.git
cd YOUR-REPO

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed.
Then install the required packages:

npm install

### 3️⃣ Run Tailwind in Watch Mode
Tailwind needs to compile styles whenever you make changes:

npm run dev

###4️⃣ Open the Project
Simply open index.html in your browser.

You can use Live Server (VS Code extension) for auto-reload:

### 🛠 Editing the Code
Modify HTML in index.html.

Update styles in css/input.css or add new Tailwind utility classes directly in HTML.

If you add new Tailwind classes, keep the --watch command running so the styles compile automatically.

npm >= 8

Modern browser
